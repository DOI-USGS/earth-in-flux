            blurb: "The Arctic Ocean is undergoing dramatic sea ice reduction and warming conditions. These changes affect the sealife of the region, including bottom-dwelling organisms and the marine mammals, seabirds, and fish that rely on them for food. The researchers of this project use micro-fossils from sediment cores taken in the Beaufort Sea to rebuild the climate patterns, sea ice and circulation, and ecosystems from the past 2000 years. By studying the bottom-dwelling, microscopic arthropods (called Ostracodes) and single-celled protists (called Forams), the Beaufort Sea researchers can compare the historical conditions of the Arctic and better understand the effects of recent climate change in the region."

            heading1: "Reconstructing past and present climates with Arctic microfossils",
            paragraph1: "As climate conditions change at the mouth of the Mackenzie River, where it spills into the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska, the small species of ostracodes and forams respond and the overall assemblage of species changes. Researchers have reconstructed the past climates of the Arctic using these microfossils. In particular, a couple species work as indicator species, which means we can monitor their growth (or lack thereof) to understand how healthy the local ocean climate is at a given time in the past or present.",
            heading2: "Meet the forams!",
            paragraph2: "Foraminifera, or 'forams', are a group of single-celled protists covered by an external shell called a 'test.' It is these tests that are found in the sedimentary fossil record and are used to identify the different species. ",
            heading2a: "Cassidulina reniforme",
            paragraph2a: "The tests of most forams, such as the Cassidulina and Elphidium species, are often made of calcium carbonate, which is highly sensitive to changes in water quality and pH. The abundance of calcium carbonate forams has declined steadily in the last century or so.",
            heading2b: "Elphidium excavatum",
            paragraph2b: "As local water chemistry changes from climate change, the environment becomes less favorable to calcium carbonate tests, and the organisms such as Elphidium excavatum that build them. Elphidium excavatum, like Cassidulia reniforme, has declined in abundance in this Beaufort Sea fossil record.",
            heading2c: "Spiroplectammina biformis",
            paragraph2c: "Some species such as Spiroplectammina create tests that are agglutinated, or formed by clumping together particles such as sand and sediment. Agglutinated species such as Spiroplectammina are able to withstand more harsh, corosive environments than some other forams, and often indicate less saline and turbid (cloudy) conditions. Spiroplectammina abundance has increased significantly in the past few decades, indicating the harsher conditions from climate change and glacial melt.",
            heading3: "Meet the ostracodes!",
            paragraph3: "Ostracodes are a microscopic species of arthropods, distantly related to crustaceans and insects. The fossil remains are from their hardened shells, each distinctly patterned. Unlike bivalve molluscs (clams, oysters, and mussels), ostracodes' bivalve-like shells are made of chitin, which is the same material as insect and crustacean exoskeletons.", 
            heading3a: "Kotorachythere arctoborealis",
            paragraph3a: "Kotorachythere arctoborealis is a species of ostracode that showed relatively low, but steady, abundance in the Beaufort Sea fossil record until more recent years. Lately, its relative abundance has been on the rise.",
            heading3b: "Paracyprideis pseudopuntillata",
            paragraph3b: "Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata is one of the most dominant species in this Arctic fossil record. However, the overall abundance has declined at the same time that Kotochythere arctoborealis and agglutinated forams are increasing.",
            heading4: "Learning from the past",
            paragraph4: "Taken together, these indicator species show us a living story of climate change in the Arctic. As glaciers melt, growing seasons change, and the Mackenzie River changes flow, the growth of indicator species change. Here, we see the relative decline of Cassidulina reniforme, Elphidium excavatum, and Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata combined with the increases in agglutinated Spiroplectammina biformis and Kotorachythere arctoborealis, which indicates that within the last 60 years or so, this region of the Beaufort Sea has been affected by climate change, including water chemistry changes."
