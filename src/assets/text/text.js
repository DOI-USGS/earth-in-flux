            motivation: "The Arctic Ocean is undergoing dramatic sea ice reduction and warming conditions. These changes affect the sealife of the region, including bottom-dwelling organisms and the marine mammals, seabirds, and fish that rely on them for food. The researchers of this project use micro-fossils from sediment cores taken in the Beaufort Sea to rebuild the climate patterns, sea ice and circulation, and ecosystems from the past 2000 years. By studying the bottom-dwelling, microscopic arthropods (called Ostracodes) and single-celled protists (called Forams), the Beaufort Sea researchers can compare the historical conditions of the Arctic and better understand the effects of recent climate change in the region.

Researchers have reconstructed the past climates of the Arctic using these microfossils. In particular, a couple species work as indicator species, which means we can monitor their growth (or lack thereof) to understand how healthy the local ocean climate is at a given time in the past or present.",

Agglutinated species such as <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina</span> are able to withstand more harsh, corosive environments than some other forams, and often indicate less saline and turbid (cloudy) conditions. <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina</span> abundance has increased significantly in the past few decades, indicating the harsher conditions from climate change and glacial melt.",

However, the overall abundance has declined at the same time that <span class='scientificName'>Kotochythere arctoborealis</span> and agglutinated forams are increasing.",
            heading4: "Learning from the past",
            paragraph4: "Taken together, these indicator species show us a living story of climate change in the Arctic. As glaciers melt, growing seasons change, and the Mackenzie River changes flow, the growth of indicator species change. Here, we see the relative decline of <span class='scientificName'>Cassidulina reniforme</span>, <span class='scientificName'>Elphidium excavatum</span>, and <span class='scientificName'>Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata</span> combined with the increases in agglutinated <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina biformis</span> and <span class='scientificName'>Kotorachythere arctoborealis</span>, which indicates that within the last 60 years or so, this region of the Beaufort Sea has been affected by climate change, including water chemistry changes."
