            motivation: "Global freshwater biodiversity faces unprecedented loss from rapid global change. Found in less than 0.01% of available surface water, inland fishes comprise 51% of all fish species and inland fisheries provide food for billions and livelihoods for millions of people worldwide. Despite their importance, inland fishes are some of the most threatened taxa on the planet from intensifying pressures, such as hydrological alterations, riparian degradation, invasive species, and climate change. One-third of all inland fishes are threatened with extinction. However, standardized methods to monitor and assess fisheries proves elusive because inland fisheries are highly dispersed with limited market integration. Here, we present the first global metric to examine threats to inland fisheries by river basin using literature synthesis, expert elicitation, and computational modeling. The resulting standardized assessment serves as a potential risk indicator for freshwater ecosystem status and its capacity to support inland fisheries. We show that most threats to inland fisheries come from outside the fishery sector, predominately from land use change. Given that inland fisheries are severely threatened and highly important with limited resources, this index can help direct, efficiently use, and mobilize limited resources for watershed management, sustainable fisheries, and ultimately human well-being.",

            title: "Fire in Ice",
            motivation: "Glaciers and ice caps around the world are melting. Glaciers serve as water towers and store freshwater that is essential for drinking water and agriculture. Losing this freshwater to the ocean results in rising sea levels. This glacial retreat is due to increased temperatures, water collecting under glaciers and hastening their movement, alterations in atmospheric circulation, and the deposition of dark aerosols on ice. Dark aerosols absorb heat and can increase melt on glacier surfaces. Black carbon is produced by both industrial burning and from forest fires. Nagorski et al. (2019) determined that black carbon is increasing the radiative forcing of the Juneau Icefield and accelerating the melt. Specific sugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan) are only produced by burning vegetation including smoldering grass fires which are often hard to analyze in the past. As coal contains cellulose, coal burning can also produce levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. Here, we collected a series of ~10 m cores across the Juneau Icefield, AK, which encompass some of the most rapidly melting glaciers on the planet, as well as a major contributor to sea level rise. Our goal was to determine if and how wildfire aerosols are affecting the Juneau Icefield. All three sugars were present in quantifiable amounts, demonstrating that wildfires are unequivocally depositing aerosols onto the icefield. Ratios between the sugars can provide information on if hardwoods, softwoods or grasses burned in the fires. The presence of hardwood fires, coupled with satellite data of smoke transport, suggest that fires as far away as East Asia may affect the Juneau Icefield.",

            paragraph2: "The ideal location for drilling an ice core is the highest, flattest section of a glacier, as this region minimizes any influence from the glacier flow. Snow builds up layer by layer on a glacier surface and eventually compresses into ice. High, flat drilling locations increase the possibility that ice layers remain horizontal and decreases the possibility of melt layers.",
            paragraph3: "Once researchers have arrived at the drilling location, the first thing that they do is to create some sort of shelter for comfort and incase the weather becomes bad. For short (~10 m) ice cores that can be drilled in a day, this shelter is often a snow pit with a bench, as well as a tarp to block blowing wind. Once the pit is dug, scientists can start drilling. The ice core drill has bits called “core dogs” on the bottom that cut into the ice. The drill is a metal cylinder with threads on the outside that help grip the snow and ice. Researchers attach a handle to the top and turn the drill until the have collected a meter of ice. This meter of ice is then passed to the people in the snow pit who are processing the core. This processing entails documenting the ice stratigraphy, measuring the core, and determining its mass. On the Juneau Icefield, cores were not kept in a frozen state, and instead were homogenized and placed into clean labeled bottles. The drilling and processing continue simultaneously, with team members measuring one core section while the next section is being drilled. The ice core drill returns to the initial hole and retrieves the next meter of ice. As the drill goes deeper and deeper into the ice, metal rods are connected to the top of the drill to extend the drill length until eventually reaching ~10 m depth. Pulling up 10 m of metal extension rods, the drill, and the ice core section can be heavy, but allows for a continuous climate record.",

They are identified in sediment samples by their external shells, which can take many different forms and be composed of a variety of materials. Under the right conditions, these shells can become fossilized in sediments, creating microfossils. The presence and growth of individual species is closely tied to environmental conditions like the pH, salinity, turbidity, and temperature of ocean water, which can affect the solubility of external shells and the availability of different food sources. By considering the known ecological preferences of observed species, researchers can use microfossils as proxies of past climates and as indicators of environmental change.",

Shifts in microorganism abundance, alongside chemical markers like biogenic silica and ratios of carbon and oxygen isotopes (not shown), reflect variability in the salinity and temperature of ocean water, ecological productivity, and the delivery of terrestrial sediment from the Mackenzie River. The record shows summer warming oscillations during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (beginning around 950 CE), and a colder more variable climate from ~1250 to 1900 CE. In the last 60 years, the record reflects larger-scale changes in the Beaufort Sea. Loss of sea ice has led to longer periods of open water. Permafrost melt has increased inflow from the Mackenzie River and made that inflow more acidic. Near the sea floor, conditions are cloudier, and productivity has increased.",
