                paragraph1: "Global freshwater biodiversity faces unprecedented loss from rapid global change. Found in less than 0.01% of available surface water, inland fishes comprise 51% of all fish species and inland fisheries provide food for billions and livelihoods for millions of people worldwide. Despite their importance, inland fishes are some of the most threatened taxa on the planet from intensifying pressures, such as hydrological alterations, riparian degradation, invasive species, and climate change. One-third of all inland fishes are threatened with extinction. However, standardized methods to monitor and assess fisheries proves elusive because inland fisheries are highly dispersed with limited market integration. Here, we present the first global metric to examine threats to inland fisheries by river basin using literature synthesis, expert elicitation, and computational modeling. The resulting standardized assessment serves as a potential risk indicator for freshwater ecosystem status and its capacity to support inland fisheries. We show that most threats to inland fisheries come from outside the fishery sector, predominately from land use change. Given that inland fisheries are severely threatened and highly important with limited resources, this index can help direct, efficiently use, and mobilize limited resources for watershed management, sustainable fisheries, and ultimately human well-being."

                paragraph2: "Glaciers serve as water towers that store freshwater that is essential for drinking water and agriculture. When glaciers melt, this freshwater is lost to the ocean, leading to sea level rise. Glacial retreat is occurring due to increased temperatures, water collecting under glaciers and hastening their movement, alterations in atmospheric circulation, and the deposition of dark aerosols on ice.",
                paragraph3: "Dark aerosols absorb heat and can increase melting on glacier surfaces. Black carbon, or soot, is a type of dark aerosol that is produced by both industrial burning of fossil fuels and forest fires. Nagorski et al. (2019) determined that black carbon increases the amount of heat absorbed by the Juneau Icefield and accelerates the melting.",
                paragraph4: "The Fire in Ice Project collected a series of ~10-meter snow cores across the Juneau Icefield, AK, which includes some of the most rapidly melting glaciers on the planet and is a major contributor to sea level rise. The goal was to determine if and how wildfire aerosols are affecting the Juneau Icefield by studying material preserved in the core layers.",
                paragraph5: "Scientists analyzed the core for specific sugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan) that are only produced by burning vegetation. These sugars are transported in smoke plumes alongside dark aerosols and are also deposited on the icefield. All three sugars were present in quantifiable amounts, demonstrating that wildfires are unequivocally depositing aerosols onto the icefield. Ratios between the sugars can provide information on the vegetation type—hardwoods or softwoods—that burned in the fires. The presence of hardwood fires, coupled with satellite data of smoke transport, suggests that fires as far away as East Asia may affect the Juneau Icefield."

Microorganisms like foraminifera and ostracodes are identified in the sediment by their shells, which can take many different forms. These organisms build their shells using calcium carbonate and other elements taken directly from ocean water. Under the right conditions, these shells can become fossilized in sediments, creating microfossils and preserving a long-term record of past ocean conditions. Ocean water pH, salinity, turbidity, and temperature affect the sturdiness of the shells and the availability of different food sources. As a result, the presence and abundance of individual species is closely tied to environmental conditions. Because of the known ecological preferences of each species, microfossils act as proxies of past ocean conditions and as indicators of environmental change in the Arctic Ocean.",
