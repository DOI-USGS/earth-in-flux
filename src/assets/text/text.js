                paragraph1: "Global freshwater biodiversity faces unprecedented loss from rapid global change. Found in less than 0.01% of available surface water, inland fishes comprise 51% of all fish species and inland fisheries provide food for billions and livelihoods for millions of people worldwide. Despite their importance, inland fishes are some of the most threatened taxa on the planet from intensifying pressures, such as hydrological alterations, riparian degradation, invasive species, and climate change. One-third of all inland fishes are threatened with extinction. However, standardized methods to monitor and assess fisheries proves elusive because inland fisheries are highly dispersed with limited market integration. Here, we present the first global metric to examine threats to inland fisheries by river basin using literature synthesis, expert elicitation, and computational modeling. The resulting standardized assessment serves as a potential risk indicator for freshwater ecosystem status and its capacity to support inland fisheries. We show that most threats to inland fisheries come from outside the fishery sector, predominately from land use change. Given that inland fisheries are severely threatened and highly important with limited resources, this index can help direct, efficiently use, and mobilize limited resources for watershed management, sustainable fisheries, and ultimately human well-being."

For short (~10 m) ice cores that can be drilled in a day, this shelter is often a snow pit with a bench, as well as a tarp to block blowing wind. Once the pit is dug, scientists can start drilling.",

This processing entails documenting the ice stratigraphy, measuring the core, and determining its mass.",

The drilling and processing continue simultaneously, with team members measuring one core section while the next section is being drilled. The ice core drill returns to the initial hole and retrieves the next meter of ice. As the drill goes deeper and deeper into the ice, metal rods are connected to the top of the drill to extend the drill length until eventually reaching ~10 m depth.

Shifts in microorganism abundance, alongside chemical markers like biogenic silica and ratios of carbon and oxygen isotopes (not shown), reflect variability in the salinity and temperature of ocean water, ecological productivity, and the delivery of terrestrial sediment from the Mackenzie River. The record shows summer warming oscillations during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (beginning around 950 CE), and a colder more variable climate from ~1250 to 1900 CE. In the last 60 years, the record reflects larger-scale changes in the Beaufort Sea. Loss of sea ice has led to longer periods of open water. Permafrost melt has increased inflow from the Mackenzie River and made that inflow more acidic. Near the sea floor, conditions are cloudier, and productivity has increased.",
