            blurb: "The Arctic Ocean is undergoing dramatic sea ice reduction and warming conditions. These changes affect the sealife of the region, including bottom-dwelling organisms and the marine mammals, seabirds, and fish that rely on them for food. The researchers of this project use micro-fossils from sediment cores taken in the Beaufort Sea to rebuild the climate patterns, sea ice and circulation, and ecosystems from the past 2000 years. By studying the bottom-dwelling, microscopic arthropods (called Ostracodes) and single-celled protists (called Forams), the Beaufort Sea researchers can compare the historical conditions of the Arctic and better understand the effects of recent climate change in the region."

            paragraph1: "Researchers traveled from Reston, Virginia to Whitefish Station, Yukon, Canada. Here, the Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea. The researchers do their sediment coring offshore, along the relatively shallow Mackenzie Shelf.",
            paragraph2: "Researchers take a large U.S. Coast Guard ice-breaking ship to the collection site.",
            paragraph3: "Once the researchers are at the collection site, they use a large piston-driven coring device to take samples of the sediment layers at the bottom of the ocean.",
            paragraph4: "The sediment in the top of the core is newer sediment than sediment at the bottom. The total time span for this sample is about 2000 years!",
            paragraph5: "Researchers then slice the core into 1-centimeter sections for testing. They measure the age of the sediment, chemistry in the sediment, and examine what species of microfossiles are present.",
            paragraph6: "Researchers identify all the species they can, collecting data on the relative abundance of each species. These species, the chemistry of the sediment, and the age help researchers reconstruct past climates.",
            paragraph7: "The microfossils are approximately a half-millimeter in size, which is about the size of a small pen mark! Not surprisingly, identifying the species takes a microscope and an attention for detail.",

            heading1: "Reconstructing past and present climates with Arctic microfossils",
            paragraph1: "As climate conditions change at the mouth of the Mackenzie River, where it spills into the Beaufort Sea north of Yukon, Canada, the small species of ostracodes and forams respond and the overall assemblage of species changes. Researchers have reconstructed the past climates of the Arctic using these microfossils. In particular, a couple species work as indicator species, which means we can monitor their growth (or lack thereof) to understand how healthy the local ocean climate is at a given time in the past or present.",
            heading2: "Meet the forams!",
            paragraph2: "Foraminifera, or 'forams', are a group of single-celled protists covered by an external shell called a 'test.' It is these tests that are found in the sedimentary fossil record and are used to identify the different species. ",
            heading2a: "<span class='scientificName'>Cassidulina reniforme</span>",
            paragraph2a: "The tests of most forams, such as the <span class='scientificName'>Cassidulina</span> and <span class='scientificName'>Elphidium</span> species, are often made of calcium carbonate, which is highly sensitive to changes in water quality and pH. The abundance of calcium carbonate forams has declined steadily in the last century or so.",
            heading2b: "<span class='scientificName'>Elphidium excavatum</span>",
            paragraph2b: "As local water chemistry changes from climate change, the environment becomes less favorable to calcium carbonate tests, and the organisms such as <span class='scientificName'>Elphidium excavatum</span> that build them. <span class='scientificName'>Elphidium excavatum</span>, like <span class='scientificName'>Cassidulia reniforme</span>, has declined in abundance in this Beaufort Sea fossil record.",
            heading2c: "<span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina biformis</span>",
            paragraph2c: "Some species such as <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina</span> create tests that are agglutinated, or formed by clumping together particles such as sand and sediment. Agglutinated species such as <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina</span> are able to withstand more harsh, corosive environments than some other forams, and often indicate less saline and turbid (cloudy) conditions. <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina</span> abundance has increased significantly in the past few decades, indicating the harsher conditions from climate change and glacial melt.",
            heading3: "Meet the ostracodes!",
            paragraph3: "Ostracodes are a microscopic species of arthropods, distantly related to crustaceans and insects. The fossil remains are from their hardened shells, each distinctly patterned. Unlike bivalve molluscs (clams, oysters, and mussels), ostracodes' bivalve-like shells are made of chitin, which is the same material as insect and crustacean exoskeletons.", 
            heading3a: "<span class='scientificName'>Kotorachythere arctoborealis</span>",
            paragraph3a: "<span class='scientificName'>Kotorachythere arctoborealis</span> is a species of ostracode that showed relatively low, but steady, abundance in the Beaufort Sea fossil record until more recent years. Lately, its relative abundance has been on the rise.",
            heading3b: "<span class='scientificName'>Paracyprideis pseudopuntillata</span>",
            paragraph3b: "<span class='scientificName'>Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata</span> is one of the most dominant species in this Arctic fossil record. However, the overall abundance has declined at the same time that <span class='scientificName'>Kotochythere arctoborealis</span> and agglutinated forams are increasing.",
            heading4: "Learning from the past",
            paragraph4: "Taken together, these indicator species show us a living story of climate change in the Arctic. As glaciers melt, growing seasons change, and the Mackenzie River changes flow, the growth of indicator species change. Here, we see the relative decline of <span class='scientificName'>Cassidulina reniforme</span>, <span class='scientificName'>Elphidium excavatum</span>, and <span class='scientificName'>Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata</span> combined with the increases in agglutinated <span class='scientificName'>Spiroplectammina biformis</span> and <span class='scientificName'>Kotorachythere arctoborealis</span>, which indicates that within the last 60 years or so, this region of the Beaufort Sea has been affected by climate change, including water chemistry changes."
