            motivation: "Global freshwater biodiversity faces unprecedented loss from rapid global change. Found in less than 0.01% of available surface water, inland fishes comprise 51% of all fish species and inland fisheries provide food for billions and livelihoods for millions of people worldwide. Despite their importance, inland fishes are some of the most threatened taxa on the planet from intensifying pressures, such as hydrological alterations, riparian degradation, invasive species, and climate change. One-third of all inland fishes are threatened with extinction. However, standardized methods to monitor and assess fisheries proves elusive because inland fisheries are highly dispersed with limited market integration. Here, we present the first global metric to examine threats to inland fisheries by river basin using literature synthesis, expert elicitation, and computational modeling. The resulting standardized assessment serves as a potential risk indicator for freshwater ecosystem status and its capacity to support inland fisheries. We show that most threats to inland fisheries come from outside the fishery sector, predominately from land use change. Given that inland fisheries are severely threatened and highly important with limited resources, this index can help direct, efficiently use, and mobilize limited resources for watershed management, sustainable fisheries, and ultimately human well-being.",

            title: "Fire in Ice",
            motivation: "Glaciers and ice caps around the world are melting. Glaciers serve as water towers and store freshwater that is essential for drinking water and agriculture. Losing this freshwater to the ocean results in rising sea levels. This glacial retreat is due to increased temperatures, water collecting under glaciers and hastening their movement, alterations in atmospheric circulation, and the deposition of dark aerosols on ice. Dark aerosols absorb heat and can increase melt on glacier surfaces. Black carbon is produced by both industrial burning and from forest fires. Nagorski et al. (2019) determined that black carbon is increasing the radiative forcing of the Juneau Icefield and accelerating the melt. Specific sugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan) are only produced by burning vegetation including smoldering grass fires which are often hard to analyze in the past. As coal contains cellulose, coal burning can also produce levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. Here, we collected a series of ~10 m cores across the Juneau Icefield, AK, which encompass some of the most rapidly melting glaciers on the planet, as well as a major contributor to sea level rise. Our goal was to determine if and how wildfire aerosols are affecting the Juneau Icefield. All three sugars were present in quantifiable amounts, demonstrating that wildfires are unequivocally depositing aerosols onto the icefield. Ratios between the sugars can provide information on if hardwoods, softwoods or grasses burned in the fires. The presence of hardwood fires, coupled with satellite data of smoke transport, suggest that fires as far away as East Asia may affect the Juneau Icefield.",
